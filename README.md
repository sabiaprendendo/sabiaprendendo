   Hi! My name is Sabrina but you can call me **_Sabi_**!🎐
 
╰─..★.──────────────────────────────────╯

👤 I am 23 years old and go by she/her. 

💻 I'm currently getting my Systems Analysis and Development degree.

🖇️ I'm dedicating myself to learn Python these days and doing the 100 days of Code Challenge. 

⚙️ I have a huuuuge interest for Cybersecurity and Backend Dev.

💭 Curious fact: I almost got a Bachelor's degree on Visual Arts, but I decided to chase after my real dreams and goals on the technology field. I don't regret this at all! 

🐠 Thank you for passing by!
